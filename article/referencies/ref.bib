Starting from the analysis of credit supply in Brazil, in the financial crisis, seeking to highlight the occurrence of liquidity preference of banks, we opted for the development of an econometric model. It was observed that the risk premium increased with the worsening of the Brazilian economic crisis in 2014.},

We address this gap by showing that aggressive bidding at central bank auctions reveals funding liquidity risk. We can extract an insurance premium from banks’ bids which we propose as a measure of funding liquidity risk. Using a unique data set consisting of all bids in all auctions for the main refinancing operation conducted at the ECB between June 2005 and October 2008 we find that funding liquidity risk is typically stable and low, with occasional spikes especially around key events during the recent crisis. We also document downward spirals between funding liquidity risk and market liquidity. As measurement without clear definitions is impossible, we initially provide definitions of funding liquidity and funding liquidity risk.}

Although a substantial literature has accumulated on this topic, relatively little attention has been given to the locational aspects of financial services. An attempt is made here to examine the spatial structure of this sector in terms of the urban system, drawing on the principles of central-place theory, the limitations and applicability of which are considered. This is followed by a discussion of the salient features of financial services within the overall urban system. After describing the differentiation of financial services in frequency terms, the hierarchical structure of the UK urban system is outlined. These two aspects are then related, in order to demonstrate the ordered nature of the spatial structure of financial services. There follows a brief discussion of the findings and their implications for future work. }

It addresses a gap in research on financial centres by illustrating overlapping institutional arrangements as an interplay between centripetal and centrifugal forces with the Global City as a theoretical backbone. The interplay is contextualised in two external shocks – EU accession and the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). The regulatory harmonisation and the general trend of capital movement create an opportunity for the capital cities to function as the national gateways to investments. However, the increasing capacity to produce larger and more complex FABS in secondary cities incentivises foreign firms to rearrange their regional office networks. Similarly, while the GFC directly impacted the financial sector, demand for the majority of services was maintained, sustaining the growth trajectories of national financial centres. The empirical analysis reveals that FABS growth in the V4 did not really accelerate in the wake of the accession, nor decelerate in the wake of the GFC. While significant differences between countries remain, the configuration of financial centres within Poland has not changed significantly, suggesting a resilient concentration and hierarchy of financial centres.}

We aim to address a gap in the research on financial centres and interurban trade by providing empirical evidence on the relationship between the complexity of services and the size of market areas across which they are traded. We utilise recent contributions to Central Place Theory (CPT), which provide us with suitably general models of interurban trade applicable to financial services. The key proposition of CPT in this respect is that more complex services are traded across larger market areas, thus translating into a further spatial reach of service centres. Given that these propositions are derived at a very general level, we rely on global city theory for explaining the underlying causal mechanisms in the context of capital market services. Our analysis examines the geography of adviser–client trade links to investigate how spatial patterns of interurban trade in capital market services are shaped by the characteristics of the services traded. We uncover evidence that more complex and larger transactions are associated with higher distance between clients and financial services providers. This in turn means that more complex services are traded across larger market areas. While clients in Central and Eastern Europe can generally find suitable providers for less complex capital market services locally, they often rely on financial services providers globally for the most complex transactions. }

  This study focuses on the impact of financial inclusion and bank concentration on the performance of firms in developing and emerging countries. Using firm-level data for a sample of 55,596 firms in 79 countries, we find that financial inclusion, i.e., the distribution of financial services across firms, has a positive impact on firm growth. This positive impact is magnified when bank markets are less concentrated, a proxy for more competition among banks. We also find that more competitive banks favor firm growth only at high levels of financial inclusion, while bank concentration is particularly favorable to foreign and state-owned firms and increases firm growth at low levels of financial inclusion. In countries with limited financial deepening, the quality of the banking system (financial inclusion and bank competition) may be as important in promoting firm performance as its overall size.}

We use these data to assess how the development potential of urban centers affects the impact of bank concentration on financing. We apply our method to Latin America, a region in which banks play a crucial role, and many loans require real estate collateral. In line with the information-based hypothesis, we find a positive relation between bank concentration and firms’ credit accessibility; and we show that the development potential of the cities in which firms are located moderates this positive relationship and helps to explain firm-level differences in access to capital.}

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Following an outline of the different types of agglomeration economy, consideration is given to transaction costs. Transaction costs may have a definite spatial dimension because institutional, commercial, cultural, and language characteristics are differentiated across the geographic space separating market agents. The concept of transaction space is introduced to represent the spatial differentiation of these characteristics, and this concept is used to cast light on how space can contribute to coordination and agency problems that raise transaction costs. Contractual agreements that are rearranged, so as to span a less heterogeneous transaction space, permit the reduction of transaction costs. Agglomeration can then be interpreted as an alternative to hierarchical structures within firms in economizing on transaction costs. The paper concludes with illustrations of how this framework may help to understand the spatial implications of corporate restructuring and new information technologies.},

At the same time, there is a growing interest in the advantages of major cities in emerging economies in providing better access to services. Yet there is little evidence on spatial variation in access to finance in the developing world. In this article, we address this gap. We propose that one important function of big cities is to provide better credit markets, but that—as countries develop—this ‘big city bias’ is likely to decline. We test these hypotheses using data on over 80,000 firms in 97 countries and provide new evidence that firms in large cities—with more than 1 million inhabitants—are less likely to perceive access to capital as a constraint. However, this big-city bias in access to finance declines as countries develop.},
