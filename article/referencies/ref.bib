  abstract={This article aims to make an analysis about the liquidity preference of banks in Brazil. We attempted to discuss the issue of endogenous money for post-Keynesians, arguing about how evolved the theory of liquidity preference of banks, and determine an effective credit demand model. Starting from the analysis of credit supply in Brazil, in the financial crisis, seeking to highlight the occurrence of liquidity preference of banks, we opted for the development of an econometric model. It was observed that the risk premium increased with the worsening of the Brazilian economic crisis in 2014.},

	abstract = {Funding liquidity risk has played a key role in all historical banking crises. Nevertheless, a measure for funding liquidity risk based on publicly available data remains so far elusive. We address this gap by showing that aggressive bidding at central bank auctions reveals funding liquidity risk. We can extract an insurance premium from banks’ bids which we propose as a measure of funding liquidity risk. Using a unique data set consisting of all bids in all auctions for the main refinancing operation conducted at the ECB between June 2005 and October 2008 we find that funding liquidity risk is typically stable and low, with occasional spikes especially around key events during the recent crisis. We also document downward spirals between funding liquidity risk and market liquidity. As measurement without clear definitions is impossible, we initially provide definitions of funding liquidity and funding liquidity risk.}
